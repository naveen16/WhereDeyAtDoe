The app opens with a google map view centered around the UT Austin campus and contains markers on each of the buildings. Around each building there is a heat map that designates how crowded the building is. The more red it is the more crowded the building is and the more green it is the less crowded it is. The user can click on the marker for the building to view the details of the building or make a report on it. In the details of the building the user can see the name of the building, the hours for the day, how crowded it is at the moment, and the history of how crowded it was on previous weeks at that time. The user can also report how crowded a certain building is by clicking on that option. On that screen they are shown the building name and a spinner with 5 options to choose how crowded it is. Each option goes up in a level of popularity at the time. The reports are valid for one hour, and the level is the average of all the reports that people made in that hour. 

As of now, since the users of the app are sparse, so there isnâ€™t too much information for the heat maps to show. However, in the beta, we plan on finding ways to fix this issue.
